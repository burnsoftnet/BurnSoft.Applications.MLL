# BurnSoft.Applications.MLL
The Main Library for the [My Loaders Log](https://github.com/burnsoftnet/MyLoadersLog) Application that handles a majority of the work that is required.

This application was seperated from the project to be added to the site nuget package so we can also use this in the [My Gun Collection](https://github.com/burnsoftnet/MyGunCollection)]
and any other related program.
